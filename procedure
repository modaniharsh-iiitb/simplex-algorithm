Solving:

- We will solve only standard-form maximization problems
- For deciding entering variable, we pick the first negative cost coefficient
- For deciding leaving variable, we pick the row with the MAX h/ ratio

Solving standard-form minimization:

- We will take the dual of the problem
- Then it will be a standard form maximization problem

Removing redundant constraints:

- We pairwise analyze each constraint row
- If the coefficients of all non-slack variables are the exact same, then discard the constraint with the greater constant (normalized)

Notes:

- use fraction instead of float
- maybe something to do with adding positive equations?
